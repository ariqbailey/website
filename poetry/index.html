On my grand peaks
Land hollowed away underneath
Man’s frenzied armies surge beneath
A roaring rumble reaches at the soles of my feet
    
Look on the four corners of this land: 
sprawling forests, 
sumptuous swamps, 
rivers turgid with my lifeblood, 
blue beaches of pristine white sand 
    
But this scene has been repainted 
by the shortsighted strokes of men 
    
Who lay roads 
Who erect traffic lights, and buildings squared off 
Slipshod facades
planted in
    
rigid city grids 
Preternatural and perverse 
Cheating the integrity 
Of my maiden material laws 
    
Fervently they seek my vanity 
Outstrip it with their blink-long dreams of insanity
    
But, the minds of men are a poor match 
For the yolk of a sunrise freshly hatched
    
No fleeting flash of the eye 
Will be as tranquil as clouds in the sky
    
No undertaking of man 
Will be as thundering as my impassive canyon/s 
    
The symphonic fervor of seven billion souls 
Closes in on me 
Crumbles the earth that is me 
Consuming, combusting, burning, melting, transmuting me
    
And soon 
they will have me 
    
They will have my beauty 
Their pitiful imitation will be ultimate

                    <div id="poem-2" class="overflow-auto col-md-9 pt-4 d-none"><h3>A life well lived?</h3>
There’s not a moment to spare
Leap from bed!
Comb your hair!
Walk stridently; with purpose
Knock off tasks
get things done

Your reputation precedes you
Your impact must succeed you

Accomplishing much,
and forgetting it all along the way
in exchange for
a quick fix of new experience

Tally a towering body count
Drink a liquor store dry
Design a recipe for 
the perfect fry

See all seven wonders 
in a single day
There’s new countries to go to, 
and ways to better yourself

To be satisfied
with the way that others see you
Satisfied 
that you did what there is to do

But there is always
more to do.

Read 10,000 books
and write a good one

Are you happy with yourself?
Are you better?
Are you the same old package, 
wrapped up in a brand-new sweater?

Or did you sip beers and kick back?
Once wondering what lay beyond
As the days ticked into weeks
blended into months
blurred into years

A life perfectly content 
unblurred by tears
And when you finally reach your nirvana of abstention
do you find yourself wishing you could escape
your quicksand surroundings?

But if you struggle
You’ll only drown faster.

And when your time was due
Did you fight?
War against your nature so entrenched?
Hand, fist, tooth and nail
Through clouded still-bright eyes
Did you give it everything you had
And still fail?

In the end
The end still having found you all the same
Whether fierce and with vitality
Or lost, acquiesced, lame

The end still finds you
all the same

                    <div id="poem-3" class="overflow-auto col-md-9 pt-4 d-none"><h3>Hold my eyes</h3>
Hold my eyes
Stay in this moment with me
Please don’t look away

I’m nervous and so are you
but things can be okay, this can be everything, just
hold my eyes

Your hair is strawberry
Mine of moonless midnight
Please don’t look away

I joke—or is it you?
We smile and giggle, but I’m still expectant,
hold my eyes

I’ve nothing to say
You speak to fill the silence; hush now
Please don’t look away

My heart is filling, fibrillating, bursting, bleeding, aching,
intoxicated with emotions awash, I implore you
Hold my eyes
please don’t look away

                    <div id="poem-4" class="overflow-auto col-md-9 pt-4 d-none"><h3>Vincent and his green wheat fields</h3>
So blue, so somber, so intense
one can only glance askance 
His fiery red hair tufting
edging his beard 
his
sharp cheekbones
sharp jaw
sharp nose

Outline surrounding, exploding
from his palette
Eyes clear deep pools
containing and absorbing his
hyperreal perception
he has so graciously shared, but

why so blue?

<i>Now I understand
What you tried to say to me
And how you suffered for your sanity</i>

How could you produce
such pleasant
works of wheat fields
grass crosshatched
and pastel days,
paint strokes, lines not radiating,
rather rolling, softly, gently,
peacefully, invitingly
yellow flowers dotting scene

How exists
both beauty and that look?
the lazy brights,
alert darks
Painter and subject,
alive in different worlds

Those eyes still stare forward.

                    <div id="poem-5" class="overflow-auto col-md-9 pt-4 d-none"><h3>Smile at me</h3>
I speak openly and you just
smile at me

Your gaze darts around the room

I ask if you’re alright and you just
smile at me

You softly intone your reassurance

But I can see you’re lying
You vibrate with unease

Is there anything I can do for you?
<i>No, I’m fine. Seriously.</i>

You lie through your teeth at me you
smile at me

I reach out
You’re defended, dismissive

Your discomfort is palpable.
It’s infectious, I inherit it

Please, is there anything I can do for you?
I just want you to have a good time

You’re beautiful and without word
you’re gone and all that remains is that
Smile
